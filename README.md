====================

Haskell client skeleton for Lean Poker. For more information visit: http://leanpoker.org

To deploy on Heroku, use the following command to prepare the application with Heroku Toolbelt:

```
heroku create -b https://github.com/mietek/haskell-on-heroku
```

It enables the usage of the [Halcyon](https://halcyon.sh/)-based [Haskell build pack](https://haskellonheroku.com).

The default port of the service is 8080. It could be changed by setting the `PORT` environment variable.
